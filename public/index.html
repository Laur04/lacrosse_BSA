                <h4>The Origin of Lacrosse</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-8">
                        <p>Originally known as stick ball, lacrosse was first played by the Algonquian Native Americans, but not for fun and enjoyment but for practice. The game was played to practice for battle, there were no boundaries and usually played in open fields 500 yards or a mile long between goals which were trees or other natural features. The estimated number of players on the field ranged from 100 to 100,000. The start of the game was indicated by the wooden or deerskin ball being thrown up in the air, then players would race to catch it. Lacrosse sticks began wooden shafts (the long part of the stick) and the netting made from deer sinews. In the 1636 French missionary Jean de Brebeuf observed the game and named the sport lacrosse. Later on in the 1800’s the game began to grow in Canada and in the 1856 a dentist named Dr. William George Beers formed the first official club, and only a decade later the first rule book was created the major advancements were in the sticks, the balls and the reduction of players on the field. So thanks to the Algonquin Natives, we can now enjoy a fast paced and very fun sport.</p>

                <h4>How to Play</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-8">
                        <p>Lacrosse is a field game normally played with 10 players, including a goalie. It is played on a field that is usually 330 feet long and 180 feet wide. The goals are 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall.They are placed 45 feet away from the end line, and encircled by a crease, generally 12 feet in diameter, players may run behind the goal, but an opposing team is not allowed to enter the other team’s crease at any given time. There are 4 positions in lacrosse, Midfielder, Attackman, Defender, and Goalie. The attackman must remain on the half of the opposing team’s goal, while defenders must remain on the half of their team’s goal. Midfielders (commonly referred to as Middies) are allow to be on both sides of the field at any time. The goalie’s job is to protect the goal at all time, the goal has a special type of lacrosse ‘head’ that is larger than the conventional lacrosse head in order to help them save a shot. Unlike how the Native Americans used to start their game,  the ball is placed in the middle of the Midfield line. Two players from opposite teams kneel down close to the ball while holding their sticks in reverse along the line. Once the Referee blows the whistle the player clamp the back of their sticks on to the ball and try to slide it out in order to ‘scoop’ (pick up the ball with your stick) the ball to gain possession. There are boundaries in the game of lacrosse, and if you or the ball go outside of them, the team who touched the ball last loses possession and the ball is given to the opposing team. Every time a goal is scored the team that scored it earns 1 point. As well as boundaries, you are also able to get a penalty, a penalty is usually given when a player swings their stick at another and hits their helmet or torso. A penalty can be called if a player is not complying with the rules, or if unsportsmanlike conduct is shown, such as taunting, unnecessary hits and/or fighting. <br><br> Once you know these rules lacrosse is a breeze, but there are three things you need to know if you would like to be good at lacrosse:</p>

                            <li>Keep your cool.</li>
                            <li>Give the game your best effort.</li>
